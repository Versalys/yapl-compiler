# Yet Another Personal Language compiler

This program was written for my class at Michigan State University, CSE450, translation of
programming languages. This compiler takes in a program written in YAPL and outputs a file
containing output statements in the language YAIL (Yet Another Intermediate Language). YAIL
is assembly-like in syntax and was specified by the course.

An interpreter for YAIL can be found in interpreter/.

As of right now, there is no plan to write an assembler to convert YAIL into an executible binary,
but that could be a fun future project.

Anyways, enjoy my compiler. It was a lot of fun to make :)
